The issue is dedicated to English documents writing. The work is aimed at analyzing linguistic peculiarities of drafting legal documents. The authors have noticed that while participating at Willem C. Vis annual International Commercial Arbitration moots in Vienna, their students show some difficulties in writing memoranda. Some years ago we were not teaching legal writing. Visiting San Diego University we paid attention to special courses taught there. Now that we organized special courses teaching legal writing, in this work the authors pay attention to business documents such as contracts, legal correspondence, claims, etc., considering that rights and duties must be validated by means of documents. In view of this, judicial documents should be drafted correctly. We truly believe that teaching documents writing now, at university, is a very important issue if we want to bring up comprehendible generation of lawyers. The work lays particular emphasis on the formal business language which is referred to as officialese and differs from other types of the English language, mostly due to specific characters of the functional usage that may be featured in classical terms of style, predetermination and main characteristics. English documents are characterized from both legal and linguistic points of view. The authors draw attention to the functional style of official language which is the defining characteristics of its key components. Official document style presupposes conditions, binding two parties in an undertaking. At the same time business correspondence syntactical pattern style is drawn to reach agreement between them. This is where the authors believe that the importance of the issue under study is in the fact that it could be put into legal practice. The work may also be beneficial for lawyer students, linguists and for all those who work in businesses, for all those who is ready for the modern business challenge.
