The issue is dedicated to English documents writing. The work is aimed at analyzing linguistic peculiarities of drafting legal documents. The authors have noticed that while participating at Willem C. Vis annual International Commercial Arbitration moots in Vienna, their students show some difficulties in writing memoranda. Some years ago we were not teaching legal writing. Visiting San Diego University we paid attention to special courses taught there. Now that we organized special courses teaching legal writing, in this work the authors pay attention to business documents such as contracts, legal correspondence, claims, etc., considering that rights and duties must be validated by means of documents. In view of this, judicial documents should be drafted correctly.
